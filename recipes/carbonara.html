<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>350g Spaghetti</li>
    <li>150g Pancetta</li>
    <li>2 Eggs (M)</li>
    <li>2 Egg Yolks</li>
    <li>125g Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
    <li>125g Pecorino Romano</li>
    <li>Some Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Some Pasta Water</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black Pepper (freshly grated)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt heavily and cook the pasta until al dente.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, crack two eggs into a large bowl and separate the yolks of the other two eggs. Put the two yolks into the bowl 
        and discard the egg whites.</li>
    <li>Grate parmigiano and pecorino into the bowl and season with black pepper and some salt.
        The Mixture should be doughy in texture, not too liquidy.
    </li>
    <li>Cut the pancetta in cubes and heat olive oil in a pan, fry the pancteta until it is crispy.</li>
    <li>Remove the pancetta from the pan and put most into the bowl as well. Keep some of the fried pancetta as a topping.</li>
    <li>When the pasta is al dente, keep some pasta water in a mug, afterwards drain the pasta.</li>
    <li>Stir the drained pasta in the hot olive oil, then add it to the large bowl as well.</li>
    <li>Gently mix the pasta and the egg-and-cheese paste until the pasta is completely coated in a creamy sauce.</li>
    <li>If the consistency is too thick, (sparingly) add some pasta water until you get a creamy texture.</li>
    <li>Top off with fried pancetta cubes and enjoy while it's still hot!</li>
</ol>
