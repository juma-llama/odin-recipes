        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1kg Radish</li>
            <li>250g Cucumber</li>
            <li>750ml Vinegar</li>
            <li>750ml Water</li>
            <li>5 Tablespoons Salt</li>
            <li>10 Tablespoons Sugar</li>
            <li>3 Teaspoons Mustard Seeds</li>
            <li>24 Peppercorns (mixed)</li>
            <li>Some Dill (optional)</li>
            <li>Clean Glass Jars</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and cut the radish and cucumber into whichever form you like.</li>
            <li>Wash and cut the dill.</li>
            <li>Fill your clean glass jars with radish, cucumber and some dill until it is filled to about 3/4.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring all the other ingredients to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once sugar and salt are fully dissolved, fill the glass jars with the (lightly boiling) fluid to the brim.</li>
            <li>Close the lid and carefully turn the jar upside down. If you can see any bubbles entering the jar, you need 
                to fasten the lid more.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Be careful</strong> while handling the hot jars and use oven and <strong>use oven gloves</strong> to prevent 
            burning yourself!</li>
            <li>Let the jars cool down and check, whether a vacuum seal formed.</li>
            <li>If all the jars are properly sealed, store them in a cool and dark place for 14 days.</li>
            <li>After 14 days you can enjoy your pickled radish!</li>
            <li>Your pickles will preserve for about 3 months. We recommend storing opened jars in the fridge, where they will stay 
                fresh for about 3 weeks.
